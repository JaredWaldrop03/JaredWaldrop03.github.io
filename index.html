            <p> Sport lovers need a easier way to determine which games will be on their location TV channels or a way to see how they can watch their wanted game if it is not playing in their location. For example, it may be difficult to try and find where and which streaming service is showing your favorite local team, making it difficult and frustrating for the sports fan. Our goal is to attempt to provide a solution to this problem. </p>
